# React-Battleship

A version of the game Battleship made with React and Redux.

Playable here.

As of right now you can only place your ships on the board programatically. Clicking the `Generate Board` button will place the ships on the board in a random configuration. Keep pressing the `Generate Board` until you have a placement that is acceptable, then press the `Start Game` button. When ready to fire, select a tile on the right hand board and click. The game log towards the bottom left keeps track of the last 10 moves by the player and computer. The sunk ships column tracks which ships have been sunk. The game will continue until either use sinks 5 ships or the `End Game` button is selected.
